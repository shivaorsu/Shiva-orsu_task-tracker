# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Task Manager Application - Login

This is a simple Task Manager application that includes login functionality. After the user successfully logs in, they are redirected to the Task Manager interface where they can manage tasks. This application uses React for front-end development and basic authentication for the login functionality.

**Login Credentials**

**Email**: test@example.com
**password**:password123


### Explanation of the `README.md`:

1. **Project Overview**: It describes how the Task Manager application works, explaining the flow of login, token storage, and redirection.
2. **How to Run**: Instructions for cloning the repo, installing dependencies, and running the application.
3. **How It Works**: A step-by-step explanation of the login flow, including hardcoded email/password and localStorage token usage.
4. **Components**:
   - **AuthLogin**: The login form logic.
   - **App.js**: Main entry component for routing.
   - **Styling**: Use of CSS and Tailwind for design.
5. **Folder Structure**: Outlines the key files and components involved.
6. **Future Extensions**: Suggestions for extending the project, like connecting to a backend, handling JWT tokens, adding the Task Manager, etc.



This README will help guide other developers or users in understanding how the project works and how to modify and extend it.
